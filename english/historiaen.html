            In his long career he epitomizes the exaltation of rock'n'roll with catchy and basic riffs, intense
            rhythms, boastful vocality, texts full of libido, testosterone, cynicism, rocker elation.

          <P>The Young family left Britain when Angus and Malcolm were still children, coming to town
            Sydney in 1963.

            In Australia they were trapped by the blues, Chuck Berry's rock'n'roll and the bands of the Invasion
            Britons, especially the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Kinks, trying to imitate Angus their sounds
            favorites with their Gibson SG guitar in their first group, Kantuckee, an ensemble later renamed
            like Tantrum.
            For his part, Malcolm held the position of guitarist in a band called
            The Velvet Underground, completed by singer Andy Imlah, Les Hall, Michael Szchefswick and Herm Kovac,
            whose music had nothing to do with the garage-experimental sounds of the homonymous New York group
            led by Lou Reed.

            In 1973, Malcolm left the Velvet Underground and formed a group that he called AC / DC, a name suggested by
            her sister Margaret, which is derived from letters etched on her mother's sewing machine.
            Margaret also suggested that Angus look for an original outfit to appear on the scene, the already
            legendary schoolboy uniform, used at that time as a joke for his young age.
            Malcolm originally held the lead guitar position, originally accompanied by bassist Larry Van.
            Kriedt and drummer Colin Burgess.
            Shortly after their formation and following the breakup of Tantrum, Angus joined as second lead guitarist.
            (passing in 1974 to the rhythmic Malcolm), occupying the position of vocalist Dave Evans ..

          <p>The first and historic live performance of the new formation took place on the end of the year in 1973
            at Checkers Nightclub, located on Sydney's Goulburn Street, where they covered songs by Chuck Berry,
            Elvis Presley and the Rolling Stones, in addition to his first own compositions, such as "Sunset Strip" or "The Old
            Bay Road ”.
            In the first months of life, AC / DC underwent various changes in its formation, falling out of the group Larry Van
            Kriedt and Colin Burgess, who were replaced by Rob Bailey and Ron Carpenter, later replaced by
            Russell Coleman and later by Peter Clark.
            This instability increased with the departure of Clark and the entry of drummer Mark Kerrante.
            Even George Young himself, who along with another member of the Easybeats, Harry Vanda, took care of the
            representation of the group and production of their first albums, held for a certain time the position of
            bass player.
            The last casualty was that of the vocalist David Evans, who was replaced by the Scotsman Bon Scott (named
            royal Ronald Belford Scott, born July 9, 1946 in Kirriemuir), former drummer and band singer
            Australians such as The Spektors, The Valentines or Fraternity, who debuted as a member of AC / DC at the
            recording of the song "Can I Sit Next To You", a single produced by the Vanda / Young couple who at the time
            it didn't have much of an impact.
            Scott became a linchpin of the group's success, thanks to his sarcasm-soaked lyrics and
            eroticism, of combative eagerness.
            His presence on stage, along with the Young brothers, made him one of the most charismatic frontmen of
            The history of rock.

          <p>His first LP was "High Voltage" (1974), an album released only in Australia that was continued by
            "TNT" (1975), album in which two new members of the band already appeared, bassist Mark Evans (born on
            March 2, 1956 in Melbourne) and drummer Phil Rudd (born May 19, 1954 in Melbourne), musicians
            those they met when the group had moved to Melbourne in 1974.

            In 1976 they released “High Voltage” (1976), their first album published beyond borders.
            Australians that offered a compilation of songs included in their first two LPs.
            This album and the next one, "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" (1976), minimalist basic rock records that
            offered a sonorous counterpoint to the bombast of the time, they were enthusiastically received by the
            lovers of the most direct and forceful rock, although their celebrity has not yet reached a mass audience.

            After "Let There Be Rock" (1977) Cliff Williams, who participated in promoting the album, replaced Mark
            Evans from "Powerage" (1978).
            These last two albums and the direct “If You Want Blood, You’ve Got It” (1978) were LPs that
            became popular in the United States as well, a status firmly confirmed thanks to “Highway To
            Hell ”(1979), a great album produced by Robert John“ Mutt ”Lange (the first of his fruitful
            collaboration) that made it into the American Top 20.
            His concerts sold out tickets around the world.

          <p>When they were in their prime, both commercially and artistically, misfortune struck
            the group, as Bon Scott died of drowning in his own vomit on February 19, 1980, due to
            alcohol abuse after a wild night out.
            He was 33 years old at the time of his death.
            His replacement was Brian Johnson, former lead singer of the group Geordie, who was a perfect fit in the bosom of
            the band.
            Johnson's first work was "Back In Black" (1980), his best-selling album that featured
            stated that the loss of Scott had not affected AC / DC's creative ability or attractiveness
            commercial. The album plays classic songs from the band such as "Shoot To Thrill", "Hells Bells" or the homonymous
            "Back In Black".

            The triumphant race of the group, sustained by the dexterity in constructing powerful themes / hymns under the dominance
            guitar maker of its leader Angus Young, he continued with multi-million dollar records such as “For Those About To Rock We
            Salute You ”(1981).
            With "Flick The Switch" (1983) the march of the drummer Phil Rudd took place, who was replaced in the
            drumsticks by Simon Wright, later replaced by Chris Slade.
            The sales were not as excessive as in previous works, but even so the group maintained a
            massive legion of fans all over the world.

          <p>LPs like "Fly On The Wall" (1985), "Who Made Who" (1986) or "Blow Up Your Video" (1988) reiterated the
            hard rock sounds from past installments, made frowned upon by a sector of music critics and worse received by
            commercial level.
            But if AC / DC were the best group in the world in their sonic registers and their followers demanded it, why
            what to change?.
            The album "The Razors Edge" (1990), produced by Bruce Fairbairn and with songs like "Thunderstruck" or
            "Moneytalks" returned to reap considerable sales.
            At the same time, their live performances were, as always, first-rate shows.
            “Live” (1992), “Ballbreaker” (1995), produced by Rick Rubin and the single “Hard As A Rock”, “Stiff Upper
            Lip ”(2000), again with George Young, and“ Black Ice ”(2008) were the following works of the
            Australian institution, a fireproof and fundamental band, energetic touchstone for any good
            rock'n'roll lover.
            In 2003 they were chosen to enter the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.

            Malcolm left the group in 2014 after suffering from dementia. He was replaced by his nephew Stevie, son of
            his older brother Stephen. With Stevie in the line-up, AC / DC released the studio album "Rock Or Bust"
            (2014).

            In 2016, the person who left the group, allegedly due to deafness, was singer Brian Johnson.
            His replacement was Axl Rose (Guns N 'Roses).
            In 2016 “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap” sounded on the soundtrack of “Suicide Squad” (2016).
            George Young died on October 22, 2017.
            He was 70 years old.
            His brother Malcolm passed away shortly after, on November 16 of the same year.
            He was 64 years old.

            In 2017, “Thunderstruck” was heard in the movie “Dos Padres Por Desigual” (2017).
            In 2018 "Back In Black" was included in "El Justiciero" (2018) and "Thunderstruck" in "Deadpool 2"

            Later "Back In Black" sounded in "Spider-Man: Far From Home" (2019).

            In 2020 they returned to record today with a new album, "Power Up" (2020), LP presented with
            the single "Shot In The Dark".
